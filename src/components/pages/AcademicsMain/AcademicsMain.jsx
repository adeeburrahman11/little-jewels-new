        <h2>Our Ideology</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Our teaching methodology is a trans-disciplinary approach and derives
          a lot from the Montessori and Play Way methods. Every concept taught
          is intertwined with concepts of other subjects that make learning more
          effective and retentive. In this manner, we strive to create a joyful,
          stress free and effective learning environment for the child.
        </p>
        <img src="\Academics_Images\idealogy2.JPG" alt="" />
        <p>
          We believe that the young mind is flexible, sensitive and is
          influenced and shaped by events in the outside world. Most of what
          children learn is acquired by exploring, playing with and observing
          relation between objects.For us each child is special and different.
          At all times, we keep the self-esteem of the child upper most in our
          mind and try to do justice to all aspects of learning.

                  ICT Integrated Pedagogy allows our children to gain a deeper
                  understanding of subject matter and help them apply these
                  learning to their experiences outside of the classroom. It
                  provides children with the opportunity to handle technological
                  tools in this fast paced world.

                <p className="overlay__description">
                  We use story telling as a pedagogical tool to open the minds
                  of the children to cultural diversity and to fuel their power
                  of imagination and creativity. Through story telling we weave
                  together concepts from various subjects, values, life lessons
                  while creating empathy and universal understanding through the
                  experiences of others.

                  Brunch in the classroom has benefit far beyond putting food in

                  children. It is 100% prepared in-house under proper hygienic
                  conditions. This goes a long way towards eliminating
                  unnecessary comparisons and ensuring all children learn to eat

                  picking up their children from school is the most crucial

                  card of the student allows school authorities to keep a tab on
                  who is coming to take children back home. At Little Jewels
